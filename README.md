# CS573 - Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I visualized for my project is the WhoGov dataset provided by Nuffield College, University of Oxford [here](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/our-research/research-centres/nuffield-politics-research-centre/whogov/whogov-download-links/). The dataset contains information about more than 50,000 cabinet members from 177 countries, spanning July 1966 - July 2016. There is a separate entry for each cabinet member, from each country, for each year. Each entry contains information such as party affiliation, gender, age and military affiliation.

## Exploratory Visualizations

In the early phase of the project I created several exploratory visualizations in order to investigate the data. 

Iâ€™ve created five visualizations to investigate the data. Each of these visualizations is provided below with a brief description:

The above chart plots the ratio of female cabinet members against the ratio of military cabinet members. There are many data points along the x-axis (corresponding to a military ratio of zero) and many points along the y-axis (corresponding to a female ratio of zero). However, there appears to be a loosely correlated inverse relationship between the female ratio and the military ratio. This observation prompted me to want to dig deeper and investigate what other variables may be correlated with or possibly causing this relationship.

The above chart was designed investigate the relationship between two other variables: (1) retention rate and (2) government type. While not a very strong indicator, the retention rate appeared to be lowest in presidential democracies (yellow bars), and highest in royal dictatorships (purple bars) and civilian dictatorships (blue bars).

The above chart plots the ratio of female cabinet members against the ratio of military cabinet members, color coded by region. Whereas the first plot displayed contained all data points for the entire 50-year span, this plot includes the average female and military ratio for each country over the last 15 years of the dataset. Several intersting points stood out in this chart. Africa has significant military presence in combination with female presence in government cabinets. Asia & Pacific and the Middle East have significant military presence with low female presence in government cabinets. Europe has the highest level of female involvement.

The above chart plots the number of countries with a female ratio of zero over time. This plot shows that the number of countries was relatively static at about 100 until 1975, when the number started to decrease. Around 2006, the number stabilized at about 10 countries, until 2013 when the number began to slowly decrease again. 

## Final Visualization

## Questions & Tasks



## Interaction in the Vizualization

There are four types of interaction that I want to add to the visualization: 
1) Tooltip: When the mouse hovers over a data point, the country name, x-variable value and y-variable value will be displayed. 
2) X- and Y-Variable Menus: There will be a dropdown to select the variable on each axis; the two dropdowns will contain the same options. Options will include: size of cabinet, female ratio, military ratio and retention rate.
3) Color Menu: There will be a dropdown menu to allow the user to change the color coding. The two options will be geographic region and government system. 
4) Slider for Year: As mentioned above, the dataset covers a 50-year span (1966 - 2016). A slider will be introduced to allow the user to select which year of data to display. 

## Schedule of Deliverables
Below is the list of tasks that I will complete for this project: 
* Clean and format data for final deliverable - 10/14/20
* Create base scatter plot using single year of data - 10/21/20
- Add x- and y-axis menus - 10/21/20
- Add color menu - 10/21/20
- Add tooltip displaying country name and x- & y-axis values - 10/28/20
* Add slider to allow user to adjust the year of data being used - 11/04/20

## Open Questions

I am fairly concerned about my ability to implement a dynamic bubble chart in D3 and React. My programming background is limited (I have done some work in RStudio and implemented a RShiny app prior to this course). I am largely patching things together in this course. I am trying to learn JavaScript and to fully understand each topic mentioned in the lectures, but it has been fast-paced and is difficult for me. I will continue trying to learn the required skills and will begin re-watching lectures to hopefully gain a deeper understanding prior to attempting this visualization.
