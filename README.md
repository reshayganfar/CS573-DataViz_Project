# CS573 - Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the WhoGov dataset provided by Nuffield College, University of Oxford [here](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/our-research/research-centres/nuffield-politics-research-centre/whogov/whogov-download-links/). The dataset contains information about more than 50,000 cabinet members from 177 countries, spanning July 1966 - July 2016. There is a separate entry for each cabinet member, from each country, for each year. Each entry contains information such as party affiliation, gender, age and military affiliation.

## Prototypes

I’ve created several visualizations to investigate the data so far. Each of these visualizations is provided below with a brief description:

The above chart plots the ratio of female cabinet members against the ratio of male cabinet members. In general there appears to be an inverse relationship between the two.

The above chart plots the ratio of female cabinet members over time; the ratio of female cabinet members appears to be increasing over time.

The chart was designed to investigate the question "How does retention rate vary across different governmental systems?" Based on the chart, it appears as though Civilian Dictatorships and Royal Dictatorships have the highest average retention rates while Mixed Democratic, Parliamentary Democracy and Presidential Democracy have lower average retention rates.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
